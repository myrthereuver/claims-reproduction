This repository contains experimental software and is published for the sole purpose of giving additional background details on the respective publication.

The repository is organized as follows:

- The "reproduction" folder contains the classification code we used for the reproduction of the classification experiments from Reimers et. al. (2019). This folder also contains their original readme files and the explanation of their code, which we succesfully used to ran our experiments.

- The "analysis-reproduction" folder contains the code we used for the further analyses in our paper, and also the code for the SVM models in our paper as well as the visualizations. These models were ran on ipython notebooks with Python 3.8.
